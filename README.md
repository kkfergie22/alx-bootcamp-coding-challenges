# Python Coding Challenges

Welcome to the Python Coding Challenges repository! This repository contains a collection of coding challenges designed to help you practice and improve your Python programming skills. Each challenge focuses on different aspects of Python, including data structures, control flow, functions, file operations, modules, and error handling.

## Challenges Included

1. **Data Structures Challenge**: Implement functions to work with various data structures such as lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries.
2. **Control Flow Challenge**: Solve problems involving control flow statements like if/else, loops, and range functions.
3. **Functions and File Operations Challenge**: Write functions to perform operations on files, such as reading data, writing data, and counting word frequencies.
4. **Working with Modules and Error Handling Challenge**: Create and use Python modules for basic arithmetic operations and handle errors gracefully.

## How to Use

Each challenge is provided as a separate Python script or module within this repository. To get started, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/python-coding-challenges.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the directory containing the challenge you want to work on:

   ```bash
   cd python-coding-challenges
   ```

3. Open the Python script or module corresponding to the challenge you want to attempt.

4. Read the challenge description and instructions provided in the comments.

5. Write your solution code in the designated area or create a new Python file for your solution.

6. Test your solution by running the script or module:
